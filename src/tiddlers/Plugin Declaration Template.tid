type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Every [[plugin|Plugin]] needs a tiddler which describes this plugin in more detail. The following fields should always be declared:

|!Field|!Value|!Note|
|''author''|``Author Jones``|//your name here.//|
|''description''|``supports foo on TW5``|//a short, sweet description of what your plugin does and is good for.//|
|''list''|``readme license history``|//a list of tiddlers that are shown in the advanced tab of your plugin tiddler. These three documentation tiddlers are a great start for documenting your plugin so users can better understand what your plugin does, what its license is, and what was added, fixed, and removed over time.//|
|''plugin-type''|``plugin``|//must be exactly this value unless you are developing a theme plugin.//|
|''source''|``https://github.com/``|//link to where users can get/update your plugin.//|
|''type''|``application/json``|//must be exactly this value.//|
|''version''|``1.0.0``|//set your version, first release ;) You may want to start with something lower during the development and beta test phases of your plugin though. Believe me...//|

You also need to set the text contents of your plugin to this specific value. Otherwise you will run into trouble booting your plugin development ~TiddlyWiki the next time.
