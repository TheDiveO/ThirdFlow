!Creating Your New Plugin

You need to create a plugin tiddler which defines the plugin itself. Plugins (other than themes and translations) usually live inside the `$:/` system namespace. Moreover, plugin authors should follow this naming convention when naming their plugins: `$:/plugins/`//author//`/`//pluginname// (for instance, `$:/plugin/TheDiveO/ThirdFlow`).

!!Plugin Sources More Sidebar Tab

The <<tf>> guides you through this process: if you've not already done so, open the sidebar "''More''" tab. Next, select "''Plugin Sources''" inside it.

!!Add New Plugin

Now, click on the topmost "''+ new plugin'' item.

This will create a new plugin tiddler --  already in editing mode, so you can right start filling in the required plugin (meta data).

Make sure to change //~PublisherName// and //~PluginName// in the title to something slightly more useful. As you edit the plugin title you should notice the "Plugin Meta Data" section to update accordingly.

Please also fill in most other fields shown in the "Plugin Meta Data" section. Please see the input field descriptions shown for those plugin fields that are currently empty. The only field you probably most of the time will leave empty is the "Plugin priority" field.

!Add Plugin Boilerplate

It is good practice to include the following three plugin boilerplate tiddlers (or four, depending on your graphical skills):

# `readme` -- a (short) readme explaining what your plugin does and how to use it. ([[Third Flow example|$:/plugins/TheDiveO/ThirdFlow/readme]])
# `license` -- ''IMPORTANT:'' how your plugin is licensed to your users.
# `history` -- a release change log, so your plugin users quickly get an overview on what's new and what has been fixed. ([[Third Flow example|$:/plugins/TheDiveO/ThirdFlow/history]])
# optionally an `icon`.

The most convenient way to create the `readme`, `license`, and `history`, and to wire them up correctly in the `list` field of your plugin) is to simply...

...click on the <$button class="tc-btn-invisible">{{$:/core/images/down-arrow}}</$button> menu indicator next to your new plugin's name in the "Plugin Sources" tab. Then choose "add plugin boilerplate tiddlers".

Et voil√†! You get the three new `readme`, `license` and `history` tiddlers, filled in from templates and ready for editing. Their titles are already correctly namespaces to belong inside your plugin.
